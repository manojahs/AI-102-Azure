LLM = Large Language Model
A Large Language Model (LLM) is an advanced type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) designed to understand, generate, and process human language.
Models like ChatGPT, GPT-4, GPT-5, Google Gemini, LLaMA, Claude are all LLMs.

🧠 GEN AI vs LLM — Simple Difference
1️⃣ Generative AI (Gen AI)

🔹 Big umbrella category
🔹 Any AI that can create new content (text, images, audio, video, code, etc.)
🔹 Includes many types of models, not just language ones.

Examples of Gen AI:

ChatGPT (text)
DALL·E, Midjourney (images)
Suno (music)
Stable Diffusion (images/videos)
GitHub Copilot (code)

Gen AI = entire family of generative technologies.

2️⃣ Large Language Model (LLM)

🔹 A type of Gen AI
🔹 Specifically focused on language (text)
🔹 Built using the Transformer architecture
🔹 Cannot generate images/videos unless paired with another model

Examples of LLMs:

GPT-4, GPT-5
Google Gemini Pro
LLaMA
Claude

LLM = a subset of Generative AI.

🎯 In One Line
Gen AI → Big category
LLM → One specific type of Gen AI that works with language
🔍 Simple Analogy

Think of it like:
Gen AI = “Vehicles”
Cars, bikes, buses, trucks, airplanes — all types are included.
LLM = “Car”
A specific type of vehicle.

So every LLM is Gen AI, but not all Gen AI are LLMs.

| Feature      | Gen AI                        | LLM                    |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Scope        | Broad                         | Narrow                 |
| Focus        | Creates any content           | Creates text only      |
| Includes     | Image, video, music models    | Text-based models only |
| Examples     | DALL·E, Midjourney, RunwayML  | GPT-4, LLaMA, Claude   |
| Architecture | GANs, Diffusion, Transformers | Transformers only      |

GPT (Generative Pre=Trained Transformer) 

Multi model LLM
----------------
A Multimodal LLM (also called Multimodal Large Language Model) is an AI model that can understand and generate multiple types of data, not just text.
A Multimodal LLM is an AI model that can process and combine multiple input types like text, images, audio, video, and more — all in one single model.

Ex:
| Model                       | Modes Supported              |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **GPT-4o / GPT-5**          | text + image + audio + video |
| **Google Gemini**           | text + image + audio + video |
| **Anthropic Claude 3 Opus** | text + images                |
| **LLaVA**                   | text + images                |
